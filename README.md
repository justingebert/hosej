# hosej
- question app for me and my friends


# process (unstructured):
- first next project look up how it works, realized it changed with next 13 a bit confusing
- not sure if enxt is right choice for this project
- using mongoose and nextjs semms more difficult -> multiple connections poosiblle (dont understand yet)
    - copy from nextjs example
- want to store user in localstorage, turns out a bit complciated with next
- build ui with shadcn/ui
- deploy to vercel and later convert to pwa with npm package
- continue adding features like new question types, 


# problems:
- daily question getter should work simple but need extra work like eventbrifge


## ideen:
- vote if question is bad ->
- trichter counter
- rating durchschnitt
- add swiping libary?


# TODO:
- [ ] multiple question types
- [ ] multiple questions per day with shadcn/ui tabs
